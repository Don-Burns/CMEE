Figure 1 (a) shows the data as it was recorded at time t against a time shifted (t+1) version of that same data.  This is done to see if a previous years temperature can be show with this data to not be independent.  The correlation of the data sampled 10000 times randomly without replacement is show in the histogram (Fig. 1 (b)).  Looking at the distribution, that there is little correlation between the randomly sampled data.
