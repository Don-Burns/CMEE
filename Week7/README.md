# Week 7 CMEE Course Repository   

## Structure  
Contains [`Code`](https://github.com/Don-Burns/CMEECourseWork/tree/master/Week7/Code) with the code produced during this week's class', [`Data`](https://github.com/Don-Burns/CMEECourseWork/tree/master/Week7/Data) with the data required for the code to run and [`Results`](https://github.com/Don-Burns/CMEECourseWork/tree/master/Week7/Results) which is where the code will output the resulting file of code if any is produced. This week also contains [`SandBox`](https://github.com/Don-Burns/CMEECourseWork/tree/master/Week7/SandBox) which is where simpler concepts are tested.
