# Week 5 CMEE Course Repository   

## Structure  
Contains [`Code`](https://github.com/Don-Burns/CMEECourseWork/tree/master/Week5/Code) with the code produced during this week's class', [`Data`](https://github.com/Don-Burns/CMEECourseWork/tree/master/Week5/Data) with the data required for the code to run and [`Results`](https://github.com/Don-Burns/CMEECourseWork/tree/master/Week5/Results) which is where the code will output the resulting file of code if any is produced. This week also contains [`SandBox`](https://github.com/Don-Burns/CMEECourseWork/tree/master/Week5/SandBox) which is where simpler concepts are tested. 

## **Table of Contents**
### [**Code**](https://github.com/Don-Burns/CMEECourseWork/tree/master/Week5/Code) - List of codes with brief descriptions.
```

  script which takes files from `../data` and creates maps.  However, many files are too large for this repository so they need to be obtained from elsewhere

```

```
  A script exploring how to make, manipulate and save maps made using coordinate specified directly in code

### [**Data**](https://github.com/Don-Burns/CMEECourseWork/tree/master/Week5/Data)  
Where inputs for the code are stored.

### [**SandBox**](https://github.com/Don-Burns/CMEECourseWork/tree/master/Week1/SandBox)  
For any testing of code or files.
