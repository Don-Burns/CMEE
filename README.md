# My CMEE Course Repository
## **Description**
A depository for following the CMEE course at Imperial College London. 
The depositoryis meant as a mean of practicing various tools useful in computational ecology such as R, python and more.
As such the material found in [The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/) is the material that will be followed to get a basic grasp of how to use these tools.

## **Structure**
The course is broken into weeks with each week covering different material.  This is reflected in the folder structure of this depository. Each week's folder will contain a data, results and code folder relating to that week's topics.
